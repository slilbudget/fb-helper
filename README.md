![FB Helper — token, cookies and ad accounts](docs/cover.png)

Chrome extension (MV3): Facebook access token, session cookies and ad account status in one popup. Read-only — it never changes anything in your ads.

## Install

1. Download `fb-helper-2.3.1.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/slilbudget/fb-helper/releases/latest) and unpack (or `git clone` and use the `fb-helper/` folder)
2. `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode**
3. **Load unpacked** → pick the unpacked folder (from a clone: `fb-helper/`; keep the folder after installing)

Chrome 121+. A Facebook tab must be open in the same profile; the ads token (EAAB) comes from `adsmanager.facebook.com`.

## Features

- **Language** — English and Russian, `RU · EN` toggle in the header. The first run follows the browser's UI language; after that the choice is yours, stored in `chrome.storage.local`, and survives a browser restart. English account statuses and disable reasons use the Marketing API names (`Unsettled`, `Ads integrity policy`, …), the same as Ads Manager.
- **Token** — reads the token from the open FB tab and shows its type: EAAB (Ads Manager), EAAI (Automated Rules), EAAG (Business Manager), EAAH (Commerce Manager), EAAd (Events Manager). Each type links to the page where that token lives. **Check** shows the profile, the app and the permissions behind the token. The refresh button next to the field re-reads the token from the FB tab (and lets you retry a token that was reported dead).
- **Cookies** — as a header string or as JSON with attributes for importing into a browser profile; **Token + cookies + UA** (Token tab) copies the three in one block — token, blank line, cookie string, blank line, User-Agent — after one `/me` read confirms the token belongs to the logged-in user (`c_user`). A token from another account is not copied, and neither is a block without a readable User-Agent. The Cookies tab also shows the profile's **User-Agent** with its own copy button. It is read from the open Facebook tab, so it is the one the page sees (an antidetect profile's spoofed value, not the popup's own).
- **Ad accounts** — status, disable reason, spend per period (today / yesterday / 7 / 30 days / all time — the larger of Meta's own total, which lags behind, and the last 30 days + today), clicks and CPC, daily limit, billing threshold, payment method, pixels, business owner; ads with statuses, rejection reasons (every reason with the placement it applies to; disapproved ads first) and, for the selected period, each ad's spend, impressions, clicks and CPC (a second read after the list; switching the period sends nothing; "All time" is Meta's `maximum`, at most 37 months). The refresh button at the top of the tab re-reads the account list only; each account's ads have their own refresh icon in the ads card (so the ads cost nothing unless you ask). The loaded list and ads are kept until the browser closes and survive FB tab or token changes; logging in as another FB user drops them.

## Safety and limits

- Requests go only to `graph.facebook.com`: on a button press, or when the **Ad accounts** tab opens with nothing loaded yet or after you reloaded the Facebook page the token came from (so the list is there without looking for the refresh button). Reopening the popup or switching tabs alone sends nothing. The token is shown only while an open Facebook tab has it and is never stored beyond the browser session.
- The account list refreshes at most once a minute (that slot is shared by the automatic load, the refresh button and every open popup; the automatic load is skipped during an API pause and with a dead session; open Facebook tabs are read in parallel, so a frozen or busy tab doesn't hold the popup), one account's ads at most once per 30 s. On an API rate-limit error all requests stop for 30 min. On a dead session (error 190 or 102) requests with that token stop until Facebook hands out a new one or you press the refresh button next to the token.
- Graph API version: `v26.0`. When Meta retires it, the extension switches to the newer version Graph names.

## Build the archive

```
(cd fb-helper && zip -qrD ../fb-helper-2.3.1.zip . -x '*.DS_Store') && zip -qj fb-helper-2.3.1.zip LICENSE
```

The Chrome Web Store package (`chrome-web-store/release/ads-helper-<version>.zip`) comes from `chrome-web-store/build.sh`.

## Tests

```
node --test test/*.test.mjs   # unit tests, no browser
node test/e2e.mjs             # real Chromium + the unpacked extension, Facebook and Graph mocked; needs playwright-core (CI runs it too)
```
